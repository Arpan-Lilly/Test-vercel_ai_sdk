## Deploying to CATS after using Backstage accelerators
Many users begin developing their applications by using an accelerator from Lilly Backstage. This is a great way for application teams to get up and running locally within minutes. Backstage accelerators are compatible with the CATS Platform.

The deployment process when deploying templates from backstage is the same as if you are deploying a custom application. you will need to follow the instructions laid out in [**Deployment Overview**](DeploymentOverview.md).

## Coming Soon
Currently the CATS and Backstage teams are in talks to auto-provision CATS resources when using an Accelerator in Backstage. This will make getting started in CATS easier and more automated. Stay tuned!
