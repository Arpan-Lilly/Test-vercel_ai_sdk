# Loki

Loki is an open-source, log aggregation system developed by Grafana Labs, specifically designed for storing and querying logs. It's part of the observability toolchain and is often used alongside [Prometheus (for metrics) and Grafana (for visualization)]. Loki is highly optimized for Kubernetes environments and aims to be a cost-effective and scalable solution for log management.

**Key Features of Loki:**

- Log Aggregation: Loki collects logs from various sources, including Kubernetes pods, servers, and applications, and stores them in a central location. This makes it easy to search and analyze logs across multiple systems.

- Kubernetes-Native: Loki is designed with Kubernetes in mind. It integrates well with Kubernetes clusters, typically using Promtail (a lightweight log collector) to collect logs from pods and push them to Loki.

- Scalability: Loki is designed to scale horizontally. It is efficient in how it stores and indexes logs, focusing on low-cost operations by indexing only metadata such as labels (Kubernetes pod names, namespaces, etc.), rather than the full text of the logs.

- Integration with Grafana: One of Loki's strongest features is its seamless integration with Grafana. Grafana allows users to visualize, explore, and create dashboards for their logs, making it easy to correlate logs with metrics and traces from other sources like Prometheus.

- Efficient Storage: Unlike traditional log management systems that index the entire contents of logs, Loki uses label-based indexing. This reduces the storage footprint and lowers the costs of operating a log management solution, making it ideal for teams that need large-scale log aggregation without the high operational overhead.


## Visualize Logs with Loki on Metrics Dashboard

Loki integrates seamlessly with Grafana, providing powerful log analysis capabilities. With Grafana’s intuitive interface, users can easily visualize, search, and correlate logs with metrics and traces. This makes Loki a central part of your observability stack, providing insights that go beyond metrics and traces alone.

**Unified Log Exploration:** In Grafana, users can query logs from Loki in real-time using a simple, yet flexible query language. The integration allows you to search logs by labels, such as Kubernetes pod names, namespaces, and other metadata. You can visualize these logs alongside performance metrics from Prometheus and trace data from Jaeger.

**Correlating Metrics, Logs, and Traces:** One of the key benefits of Loki in Grafana is the ability to correlate logs with metrics (from Prometheus) and traces (from Jaeger). For example, if a metric indicates high CPU usage or errors, you can drill down directly into the related logs to pinpoint the cause. Similarly, if traces show an issue in request flow, you can view the corresponding logs for more detailed context.

**Custom Dashboards:** With Grafana, you can create custom dashboards that combine logs, metrics, and traces in one view, offering a complete picture of system health and behavior. These dashboards can be tailored to your application's specific needs, making it easier to detect, debug, and resolve issues faster.

**Alerting and Notifications:** You can configure alerts based on specific log patterns or log levels (e.g., errors or warnings). Grafana’s alerting system allows for notifications via email, Slack, or other communication channels, so teams can proactively respond to issues before they escalate.

Loki's integration with Grafana makes it a key tool in monitoring and troubleshooting your applications, ensuring that logs are not only stored efficiently but also easily accessible and actionable.


## How to use Loki in CATS

As there is no user interface for Loki, the only way to query Loki for logs is through Grafana. Please see the [Grafana](./Grafana.md) documentation for utilizing the tool.
