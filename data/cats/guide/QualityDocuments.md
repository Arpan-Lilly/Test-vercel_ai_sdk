# Quality Overview 

CATS is a GxP Qualified Platform under Security code RC4. We have all documentation up to date and approved in Veeva Vaults - Quality Docs.

## Security Administration and SOP

The security plan documents the physical and logical security controls for the system which are based upon the classifications detailed in section 1.1 â€œOverview of Security Model" and the expectations of LQP-302-29 Computer Systems and Platform Security. The purpose of this Security Plan and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to describe processes and procedures necessary to maintain and support the Cloud Applications and Technologies as a Service (CATS) platform to ensure it remains in a validated state.

Access to all computer systems and data must be controlled and managed with the goal of protecting company assets from unauthorized access, inadvertent or unauthorized alteration or destruction of systems or the data contained within the system. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) addresses the security administration procedures used to protect and limit access to the computer system, including source code. It describes how the system addresses access review, electronic signatures usage, and access to the computer system (including hardware, software, documentation, and data) to authorized users.

## Disaster Recovery Plan
This plan is focused on the Cloud Applications and Technologies as a Service (CATS) Platform and how the platform team will handle the event of a disaster and how the recovery of the platform because of said disaster. A disaster causing a widespread loss of system usage invokes the execution of the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). The System Custodian declares whether a disaster has occurred, and implementation of a recovery plan is appropriate. Once declared, the System Custodian begins executing the DRP.
