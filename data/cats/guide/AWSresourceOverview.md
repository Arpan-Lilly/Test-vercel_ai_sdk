# AWS Services and Resource Overview

The CATS Platform allows users to leverage a wide range of AWS services to support their deployments. You have three options for integrating AWS services with your CATS deployments:

1. Utilize Services in the CATS AWS Account
Access the services already available in the CATS-managed AWS account.

2. Stand Up a new AWS account seperate from other solutions
Stand up your own AWS account, provision resources there, and establish cross-account communication with CATS to integrate these services into your deployments.

3. Connect to Existing AWS Accounts
If you already have resources in a separate AWS account, you can connect and use them within CATS by configuring cross-account communication.



The resources/services available to be used in the CATS AWS Accounts are: 

- Bedrock 
- ECR 
- RDS
- S3 storage via Cloud Browser
- Secrets Manager 


If you wish to use a service not listed above, youâ€™ll need to configure a cross-account connection to link your resources with the CATS platform. For detailed guidance on how to set this up, refer to our cross-account configuration instructions [here](./ExternalResourceConnection.md).
