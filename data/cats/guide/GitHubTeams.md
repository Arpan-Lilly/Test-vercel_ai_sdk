# **GitHub Teams for CATS**

Role-based access to CATS team code in GitHub is managed through [GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/EliLillyCo/teams).

Least-privileged access should be granted to users based on business need in the following hierarchy.

The following is the apparent hierarchy of CATS teams. Note that these are currently not consistently implemented as of April 23, 2025. Please verify team access before assigning roles.
