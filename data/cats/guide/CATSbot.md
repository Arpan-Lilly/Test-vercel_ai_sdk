### Initiating the Bot

To begin chatting with CATSbot using the "ELI LABS for Teams" application, you first need to initiate the chat by mentioning the application in the Teams chat where it has been added. For example, type something like `"@ELI LABS for Teams, tell me about CATS"`. This action will add the application to the chat group and prompt you to select a model. Find the CATSbot model, star it to mark it as a favorite for easy access, and then click the chat bubble icon to start interacting with it. Once you‚Äôve favorited the model and confirmed the name, you‚Äôre ready to begin chatting. 

To ask questions, simply tag the application again (e.g., @ELI LABS for Teams) and type your query. This allows you and your peers to chat with CATSbot in Teams group chats while working.
