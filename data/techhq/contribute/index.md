# Contributing to TechHQ

Inspired by the collaborative spirit of wikis and inner sourcing, we invite contributions from across Tech@Lilly, from minor edits to new document creation.

To author _high-quality, reusable content_ that empowers our tech leadership and architects, we have these flexible
principles:

1. 📌 **Prioritize Key Content**: Focus on creating and updating content for priority initiatives, products, or
   services.
2. 🧭 **Clear Decision Guides**: Ensure use cases are clear and focus on current technologies.
3. ✂️ **Simplify Content**: Keep content simple and reference supporting details where necessary.
4. 🚀 **Speed to Draft**: Quickly produce and share initial drafts to gather early feedback.
5. 🤝 **Promote Collaboration**: Invite contributions and reviews from various stakeholders.
6. 🖼️ **Use Visual Aids**: Simplify complex concepts with diagrams and flowcharts.
7. 📋 **Highlight Key Takeaways**: Summarize important points at the beginning or end of each guide.
8. 🌍 **Real-World Examples**: Include case studies and practical examples.
9. 🔄 **Regular Updates**: Periodically review and update content to stay current.
10. 🔍 **Ensure Accessibility**: Follow best practices to make content accessible to all.

By adhering to these, we ensure our content remains impactful, relevant, and accessible to all members of our tech
community.
