# ðŸ§­ Decision Guides

Decision guides are essential tools designed to accelerate the decision-making process, increase enterprise scale, and enhance value. Created by Tech@Lilly Working Groups, these guides provide structured and reliable support for your decisions. __If you need a guide that isn't currently available, please contact Enterprise Business Architecture.__

## Decision Guide Stages
Our Decision Guide lifecycle consists of three key stages, which each guide will denote:

1. __Draft__: In this initial stage, the guide is being developed and refined by the Tech@Lilly working groups. It is not yet complete and may undergo several revisions.
2. __Request For Comment__: At this stage, the draft guide is made available for feedback from stakeholders and other relevant parties. This phase is crucial for gathering input to ensure the guide is comprehensive and meets the needs of its intended audiences.
3. __Living Document__: Once all feedback has been incorporated and the guide is finalized, it becomes a Living Document. This status indicates that the guide will be continuously updated and revised as needed to remain current and relevant.

## Reuse Vs. Build Vs. Buy
Naturally, not every business solution will require building or integrating components. We'll direct you to __[Use](/docs/use/)__ available tech, tools, and services when applicable to do so.

<summary>When formulating a solution, consider the following steps:</summary>
1. __Identify Requirements__: Understand the specific needs and goals of the business. This includes both functional requirements (what the solution should do) and non-functional requirements (how the solution should perform).
1. __Evaluate Existing Solutions__: Look for ready-to-use solutions that can meet some or all of the requirements. These could be off-the-shelf products, open-source tools, or existing systems within the organization.
1. __Determine Build vs. Buy__: Decide which components need to be custom-built and which can be integrated from existing solutions. Building components allows for tailored functionality but can be time-consuming and costly. Using existing solutions can save time and resources but may require compromises on customization.
1. __Design Integration__: Plan how the different components will fit together. This involves defining interfaces, data flows, and communication protocols to ensure seamless integration.
1. __Consider Scalability and Flexibility__: Ensure that the solution can grow and adapt to future needs. This might involve choosing modular components that can be easily replaced or upgraded.
1. __Manage Risks and Dependencies__: Identify potential risks and dependencies that could impact the solution. Develop strategies to mitigate these risks and manage dependencies effectively.
