## Augmented Reality with Smart Glasses

Augmented Reality (AR) using Smart Glasses or Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) is technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the userâ€™s perception and interaction with their environment.

Vendor/Product(s): [Apple VisionPro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), [Microsoft HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), [Toshiba dynaEdge](https://us.dynabook.com/smartglasses/products/index.html)

Uses:
* training with 'flight simulator-like' immersion
* manufacturing & engineering with 'sportscaster/meteorologist'-like real-time guidance
* product design 
* empathy to experience conditions like Alzheimer's or PTSD

Other forms of AR include [mobile](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/), [projection](https://medium.com/@sakshi.dumbre31/projection-based-ar-220240721883), [superimposition](https://medium.com/@pusalabhuvansaikrishna/augmented-reality-746893f64262)

## Digital Humans
Digital humans are highly realistic, computer-generated representations of people that can interact in virtual environments. They combine lifelike appearance with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to mimic human behaviors and communication.

## Natural Language Query
Natural Language Query (NLQ) enables users to interact with complex databases and knowledge graphs using ordinary human language, eliminating the need for specialized query language skills.

## Workflow Orchestration

Workflow orchestration automates the coordination and management of complex IT processes across various systems and teams, ensuring efficient, error-free execution by integrating tools, managing dependencies, scheduling tasks, and allowing real-time adjustments.

Vendor/Product(s): [Temporal](https://temporal.io/product), [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)

Temporal is often preferred over Airflow due to its durability, reliability, and ability to manage long-running workflows with persistent state management. It uses a code-first approach, making it easier to define and manage workflows, and can scale efficiently to handle millions of concurrent executions. In contrast, Airflow is more focused on data pipeline orchestration with a configuration-driven approach.
